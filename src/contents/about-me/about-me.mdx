    Hello! Welcome to my digital space. Here, I share my journey, lessons learned, and experiences in the world of technology.
  </p>
</section>

## Who I Am

I am a developer passionate about creating elegant solutions for complex problems.  
My journey began a few years ago, and since then, I've been exploring different technologies and frameworks.

## My Tech Stack

I currently work primarily with modern web technologies, always striving for best practices and keeping up with market trends.

### Frontend

- React and TypeScript for robust applications
- Astro for fast static websites and blogs  
- Tailwind CSS for efficient styling
- Next.js for full-stack applications

### Backend & Tools

- Node.js and Express for APIs
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB for databases
- Docker for containerization
- Git for version control

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here

This blog is my space to share:

- Tutorials and technical guides
- Thoughts on software development
- Personal projects and experiments
- Tips and tricks I learn along the way

## Development Philosophy

> "Clean code is not written by following a set of rules.  
> You don't become a software craftsman by memorizing a list of dos and don'ts.  
> Professionalism and craftsmanship come from values and discipline."

I believe good code is code that can be easily understood and maintained.  
I always prioritize readability and simplicity without compromising functionality.
