## Who I Am

Hi, my name is Davi Santana, i am a software developer living in São Carlos, Brazil. My dream is basically to create big things, that run in even bigger servers and reach an enormous number of people. My study and work focus is at the architecturing, development, maintenance and monitoring of distributed system. In addition I aim to study more about parallel computing (CUDA, OpenCL) and MLOps in the future.

I started in the area by curiosity of how the finance market, mainly the banks, handled a lot of payments in the same time. That drove me to start a technical degree in web development in 2021. In 2024, I began my studies in Information Systems with coursework specialization (minor) in Distributed Systems and High-Performance Computing at the University of São Paulo, in São Carlos, the largest university in Latin America. In the moment I work at Tekna.Rocks, a software consultancy based both in Brazil and the United States where I mainly work with distributed systems with high workloads, developing and monitoring 15+ services.

My objective is to finish my current degree and gain more work experience, after some time, concomitantly with my work I wish to pursue a master's degree. Someday I want to have a PhD in Distributed Systems, inovating in the public and/or private sector.

Beyond the IT area, I have history and economy as fields of big interest (I considered studying economy for a long time).

As my hobbies I have programming, mostly utilizing languages that I don't work with on my day to day basis, anime, manga and music.
